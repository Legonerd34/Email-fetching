# Email-fetching
A simple script to fetch the html content of an email

This can be done with any gmail account but possibly at the cost of security.
All that you need, is to ensure that your gmail account has IMAP enabled this can be be found in settings/POP3 and IMAP.
Once that is done you need to ensure all the modules are installed in the directory

```
npm install
```

You may notice there is a missing NodeScript api which I made for myself you can make your own if you wish or just use the output.html file the output will go into.

# NodeScript API

  <li>Go to <a href="nodescript.dev">NodeScripts website</a>> and sign up for an account</li>
